Therefore, the tradition calls for offering the fresh harvest of rice cooked in boiling milk to the deity.[1] While the pongal is cooking, onlookers sometimes shout with joy, "Pongalo pongal!" ('Let the pongal rise up!')Pongal (lit. 'to boil over') is a South Indian and Sri Lankan dish of rice cooked in boiling milk.[1][2] Its preparation is the main custom associated with the Pongal festival. It is also eaten as a breakfast food.[3] A part of Tamil cuisine, varieties include venn (hot) pongal, sakkarai (sweet) pongal, kozhi (chicken) pongal, and sanyasi pongal. It has been described as "very dear to (the) Tamil people."[2].</p>
